[Update 1.5]
Login, Logout, new features, bug fixes


All commands currently use https json requests - updated to V1.2 which adds some fun easter eggs and bug fixes. Should be pretty self explanitory.

UserDefaults now saves the access_token for later use. V1.3 will include full Login/Logout features and more battery controls.

Depending upon the amount of updates to the application, the V1.3 release date will likely be in the last week of April. As far as V1.5 and even V2.0, May and June will be the target release dates.
